# Find-me-Syn-Ant-onyms-

This desktop application is developed solely for personal use as a means to practice using Unity and enhance my coding skills. It is not intended for commercial purposes or public distribution. The project serves as a learning tool to improve my understanding of game development and programming techniques.
